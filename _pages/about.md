## Biography
Hi! I am a full-time Research Assistant in the Department of Linguistics and Translation at City University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Prof. LAI Jackie Yan-Ki](https://sites.google.com/view/jyklai) and co-supervised by [Prof. Aini Li](https://ainili-linguist.github.io/index.html). Before that, I received an M.A. degree in Language Studies focusing on Corpus and Empirical Linguistics at City University of Hong Kong in 2024. My research interests mainly lie in sociolinguistics, language varation and change as well as corpus and experimental methods.
